# Dynamic Decision-Making Model

![The general algorithm workflow](./sampleOutputs/modelWorkflowImg.png)


A dynamic decision-making model that incorporates various factors influencing choice and goal attainment over time:

F‚Çô = P‚ÇÄ * kF‚Çô‚Çã‚ÇÅ + m(T(f(I‚Çô, IŒî)) + R(D‚Çô, FM‚Çô))


Where:

- `F‚Çô` = Choice Taken
- `P‚ÇÄ` = Initial Goal
- `kF‚Çô‚Çã‚ÇÅ` = Effect of the previous moment on the Declared Goal
- `m` = A rate vector (time, etc.)
- `I‚Çô` = The original factual information
- `IŒî` = Facts acquired throughout the process
- `D‚Çô` = A potential choice (vector of choices)
- `FM‚Çô` = Subjective and Objective assessments performed on `D‚Çô`, considering `P‚ÇÄ * kF‚Çô‚Çã‚ÇÅ`, `I‚Çô`, `IŒî`, `ùëá(ùëì(ùêº_ùëõ,ùêº_Œî ))`
- `R(D‚Çô, FM‚Çô)` = Information Gained from choosing process, where `IŒî` + `T(f(IŒî))`

## How it Works

**Dynamic Decision-Making Model Equation:**

```
F‚Çô = P‚ÇÄ * kF‚Çô‚Çã‚ÇÅ + m(T(f(I‚Çô, IŒî)) + R(D‚Çô, FM‚Çô))
```

**Explanation:**

The equation represents a recursive decision-making process that takes into account various factors over time:

**1. Initial Goal (P‚ÇÄ):**
- Represents the desired outcome the individual wishes to achieve.


**2. Previous Moment Effect (kF‚Çô‚Çã‚ÇÅ):**
- Accounts for the influence of the previous decision on the current goal.
- kF‚Çô‚Çã‚ÇÅ indicates how much the previous decision outcome affects the current goal setting.


**3. Rate Vector (m):**
- Represents the rate at which factors such as time, motivation, and attention influence the decision-making process.


**4. Factual Information (I‚Çô and IŒî):**
- I‚Çô represents the initial factual information available.
- IŒî reflects newly acquired facts throughout the process.


**5. Choice Potential (D‚Çô):**
- Represents the potential choices available at the current decision point.


**6. Subjective and Objective Assessments (FM‚Çô):**
- Considers both subjective assessments (personal beliefs, values) and objective assessments (factual information, feedback) to evaluate each potential choice.


**7. Information Gain (R(D‚Çô, FM‚Çô)):**
- Represents the amount of information gained from the decision-making process.
- This includes both the new factual information acquired and the insights gained from the evaluation process.


**The equation works as follows:**

- The initial goal (P‚ÇÄ) and previous decision effect (kF‚Çô‚Çã‚ÇÅ) are combined to determine the updated goal.
- The rate vector (m) is used to adjust for temporal factors.
- The factual information (I‚Çô and IŒî) and subjective/objective assessments (FM‚Çô) are considered when evaluating potential choices.
- The information gained from the decision-making process (R(D‚Çô, FM‚Çô)) is added to update the goal.


**Overall, this dynamic decision-making model takes into account the evolving nature of goals, the gradual acquisition of information, and the influence of previous decisions on future choices.**
