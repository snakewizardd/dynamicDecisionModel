# Dynamic Decision-Making Model

A dynamic decision-making model that incorporates various factors influencing choice and goal attainment over time:

Fₙ = P₀ * kFₙ₋₁ + m(T(f(Iₙ, IΔ)) + R(Dₙ, FMₙ))


Where:

- `Fₙ` = Choice Taken
- `P₀` = Initial Goal
- `kFₙ₋₁` = Effect of the previous moment on the Declared Goal
- `m` = A rate vector (time, etc.)
- `Iₙ` = The original factual information
- `IΔ` = Facts acquired throughout the process
- `Dₙ` = A potential choice (vector of choices)
- `FMₙ` = Subjective and Objective assessments performed on `Dₙ`, considering `P₀ * kFₙ₋₁`, `Iₙ`, `IΔ`
- `R(Dₙ, FMₙ)` = Information Gained from choosing process, where `IΔ` + `T(f(IΔ))`
